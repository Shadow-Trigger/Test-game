Simplistic tower defense game because I'm bored and class and my school blocked all the gaming sites... T-T
**How to play?**
_Place towers along the path, they autoattack the square enemies_
_The map shifts every 20 seconds so place towers carefully_
_Try not to let any enemies get through too much_

This code is buggy, dont questions it too much lol
